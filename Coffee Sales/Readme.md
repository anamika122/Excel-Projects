## Overview of Coffee Sales Trends
- **Total Sales Over Time:** 
  The sales analysis reveals a fluctuating trend for coffee types over the years. **Arabica** and **Excelsa** demonstrated a peak in 2020, followed by a gradual decline. **Liberica** and **Robusta** experienced consistent underperformance, particularly in recent years.
- **Observation:** 
  The sharp decline across all coffee types post-2021 may indicate external factors affecting sales, such as market saturation or changes in consumer behavior.

## Performance by Country
- The **United States** emerges as the top-performing market, contributing **$35,639**, which constitutes the majority of the revenue. In contrast, **Ireland** and the **United Kingdom** contributed significantly less at **$6,697** and **$2,799**, respectively.
- **Key Insight:** 
  The disparity suggests untapped potential in European markets. A strategic marketing push in Ireland and the UK could bridge the gap and diversify revenue streams.

## Customer Segmentation
- Among the top customers, **Allis Wilmore** leads with a contribution of **$317**, closely followed by **Brenn Dundredge** and **Terri Farra** at **$307** and **$289**, respectively.
- **Observation:** 
  Customer loyalty programs could further incentivize repeat purchases and enhance the contribution from mid-tier customers like **Nealson Cutler** and **Don Flintiff**.

## Impact of Roast Types and Product Sizes
- **Roast Types:** 
  The inclusion of filters for Dark, Light, and Medium roasts provides valuable insights. Medium roasts appear to sustain interest across multiple years.
- **Sizes:** 
  The dominance of **1.0 kg packs** indicates a preference for bulk purchases, reflecting either cost-efficiency or demand from frequent consumers.

## Business Recommendations
1. **Geographic Expansion:** 
   Focus marketing efforts on underperforming regions such as the UK and Ireland to boost sales.
2. **Customer Loyalty Programs:** 
   Introduce rewards or discounts for top customers to strengthen their loyalty and encourage higher spending.
3. **Product Diversification:** 
   Consider launching new flavors or blends targeting niche audiences to revitalize sales trends in declining categories like Liberica and Robusta.
4. **Roast-Specific Promotions:** 
   Tailor advertising for medium roast products, leveraging their popularity to sustain revenue growth.
5. **Sales Recovery Plan for 2022:**
